<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I’m Sai Tay Zar Tun and I was born in Kyaukme Located in Northern Shan State, Myanmar. I am the youngest son in my
  family Although I come from a place that doesn’t have advanced Technology and computer literacy I am the one and only
  person who is interested in Computer Science in my family. When I was young, I intended to study at Yangon University
  with a major in Computer Science. Due to Covid and political Instability in Myanmar, I joined as a CDM student and
  didn’t apply to any university after I passed the matric exam. Currently, I am studying at Mae Fah Luang University
  with a major in Software Engineering and I am going to be a sophomore in this 2024-25. Additionally I’m working part
  time job at Spring University Myanmar with a poistion Operation Assistant under the School of Federalism and Peace
  Studies</p>

<p>Prior to 2022, I worked part-time in various online volunteering programs and camps, which expanded my network and
  fostered my independence. Currently, I am working part-time as an operations Assistant at Spring University Myanmar
  (SUM), not for my own profit but to stay involved in the Revolution in some way.  My passion for software development
  ignited when I researched the field of Software Engineering, and realized its potential to improve and solve a
  multitude of problems in our daily lives. Fortunately, in  mid-2022, my brother introduced me to a programming teacher
  at Concept X International School, and she guided me to dive into the programming world starting by volunteering as an
  intern at that school. As a computing assistant at Concept X, I gained valuable experience and enhanced my programming
  skills as well as soft skills, social skills, and problem-solving abilities. Teaching basic programming skills such as
  Scratch and computing theory, to primary students solidified my love for programming and coding. While teaching, I
  continued studying programming languages like Python and Java. After working at ConceptX for approximately six months,
  I saved enough money to apply to Universities in Thailand. Among them, I found Mae Fah Luang University as an ideal
  place to pursue my bachelor’s degree and advance my career goals. I must honestly disclose that my family has faced
  financial difficulties since the revolution in Myanmar, as both of my parents joined the Civil Disobedience
  Movements(CDM). </p>

<p>My biggest dream is to work as a software engineer at Google, specifically in the field of artificial intelligence.
  This experience would allow me to hone my skills and gain invaluable knowledge for my eventual goal of creating an
  "Optical Barriers Breaker" (OBB) which is my biggest future plan for my technological innovation. OBB will be the
  combination of an AI and smart glasses but it would translate languages all over the world while bringing users into
  the virtual comic world. While ambitious, this project received positive feedback during my first semester, and I
  remain dedicated to its future development. </p>
